# General useful utility functions for Python projects.

These are functions I use every day. Ideally they should make their way into the standard library.
I understand we cannot put everything in the standard library, hence this package. ;)

The various modules have the following requirements:

## util_email
imapclient
pyzmail

## util_fs
unidecode

## util_ftp
ftputil
paramiko

## util_image
pillow

## util_logging
logging_tree

If you only need one module it is recommended you install from source and manage the requirments yourself.
